Documentation for Harvard Geneds:

HOW TO COMPILE?

In order to compile Harvard Geneds, you must have a folder named "a_finalproject", which contains the project's HTML, Python, CSS
and SQl code. If you are not in the a_finalproject folder, please use command "cd" to change your directory to the correct one. Make
sure to be in this folder; otherwise, the project will not run.

It will be necessary to have these files in order to run the code. To run the program, use the command "flask run", once you are
inside the a_finalproject folder in your CS50 IDE terminal. Please click on the link provided in the terminal to open the web-based
platform of the project. Once this is done succesfully, our website will be open in your browser under a new tab.


HOW TO USE THE WEBSITE?

Harvard Geneds is a very user-friendly platform. Follow the instructions on the website, which will instruct you to select the
general education requirements you still need to complete. We are aware that many classes fulfill various general education
requirements, but it is up to you to select which one you still have to fulfill based on the ones you have already taken.

After selecting the general education requirements you still have to fulfill and pressing the submit button, a list with all the
classes you can take to fulfill the requirements will show up as well as the Q scores associated with them.

With this information, you will have an easier way to fully visualize all the classes you must take and how to better shape and plan
your Harvard academic experience.
